# Gigabyte-Z490-AORUS-Pro-AX-EFI-OpenCore-

**WARNING** This is taken from AORUS Elite EFI and has been modified to work with the motherboard for the time being. Will update soon with proper configurations.

Presently everything seems to work including Sleep, WiFi, Bluetooth (Fenvi TV919 + disabled the onboard WiFi + Bluetooth module). I'm relatively new to Hackintosh so please take it as a grain of salt and use it just to load up your system. Won't suggest to use it as your main system for stability.
