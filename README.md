Hello everyone,</br>
I'm sharing my EFI for Gigabyte AORUS Pro AX here. I've completely created this from scratch through the great guide from Dortiana / OpenCore. It's a solid stable build and I have been daily driving this system for my main work. Always open to feedbacks and to improve it further!</br>
Cheers.</br>

**BIOS Settings**

* **Tweaker [TAB]**
	* Extreme Memory Profile (XMP): Enabled (if supported by RAM)
	* Advanced CPU Settings
		* VT-d: Enabled (disabled in config.plist anyway, so only relevant to Windows)
		* Intel Speed Shit: Enabled
* **Settings [TAB]**
	* Platform Power
		* Platform Power Management: Disabled
		* ErP: Enabled (so USB Power turns off, after PC is shut down)
	* IO Ports
		* Internal Graphics: enabled (if CPU has integrated graphics). **NOTE**: The config.plist uses dGPU for Display(s) and iGPU for computational tasks only by default. If you want to use the iGPU to drive a display you need a different Framebuffer Patch.
		* OnBoard LAN Controller: Enabled
		* Audio Controller: Enabled (if On-Board Sound Card is used)
		* Above 4G Decoding: Enabled
		* Re-Size BAR Support: Disabled
		* IOAPIC 24-119 Entries: Enabled
		* Super IO Configuration
			* Serial Port: Disabled
		* USB Configuration
			* Legacy USB Support: Disabled
			* XHCI Hand-off: Enabled
		* Network Stack Configuration
			* Network Stack: Disabled
* **Boot [TAB]**

## [üî•] Update
Since the last update, I've removed the Fenvi module and am using completely onboard WiFi + Bluetooth thanks to OpenIntelWireless. In my opinion, this gives much better reception and coverage. AirDrop, Continuity, HandOff and AirPlay works now without any problems. On the next patch I'll update it to 0.7.5 as well.
</br>
Also I've been using the BSXiMacSilver theme for the bootloader and I quite like it. You could always change to the default ones included on the folder.
</br>
</br>

## [üíö] What Works
- [x] **MacOS Monterey 12.3**
- [x] In-built Wi-fi and Bluetooth
- [x] Audio: Realtek ALC1220-VB (AppleALC.kext, layout-id=7,FakeID.kext, FakePCIID_Intel_HDMI_Audio.kext)
- [x] USB - All ports including front USB ports (NZXT S340 Elite)
- [x] Using iMacPro1,1: Amazon Prime Video and Netflix in Safari, AppleTV
- [x] Shutdown
- [x] Restart
- [x] Facetime + iMessages
- [x] Handoff
- [x] Upgrading to newer MacOS versions. I had upgraded from Catalina to recently Monterey without any issue.
</br>

## [üíî] What Doesn't Work
- [ ] Sleep is a hit/miss when using iMacPro1,1. Sometimes the system Sleeps automatically but never works when forced. iMac20,1 works 90% of the time.
- [ ] (Outside my control) Onboard LAN support has been removed for Intel i225V. If you require that, don't upgrade to Monterey.
- [ ] (Outside my control) Airdrop. You'll need a native compatible PCIe card, like Fenvi TV919 for it to work. If you have that, remove BlueToolFixup.kext, IntelBluetoothFirmware.kext and IntelBluetoothInjector.kext.
- [ ] [WIP] iGPU doesn't work when using iMac20,1 as a headless accelarator. dGPU always works as its natively supported.
</br>

## [üö®] Warning
**Please change your SMBIOS details on the config.plist to your own before using, otherwise your system won't boot.**
</br>
</br>

## [‚òòÔ∏è] Installation
‚Ä¢ Create a bootable USB</br>
‚Ä¢ Copy the EFI Folder to your removable storage</br>
‚Ä¢ Open Config.plist and add your SMBIOS details etc. and save it</br>
‚Ä¢ Boot into the drive and install</br>
‚Ä¢ Post-install, copy the EFI into your hard disk.</br>
‚Ä¢ Done.
